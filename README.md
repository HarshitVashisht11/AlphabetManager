# Alphabet Manager - C++ Linked List Implementation

This is a C++ program that demonstrates how to manage a list of alphabets using a linked list data structure. The program allows users to insert, delete, search, update, and display alphabets in the list.

## Features

- Insert an alphabet to the list along with a corresponding node number.
- Delete an alphabet from the list based on the given alphabet.
- Search for an alphabet in the list and display the corresponding node number.
- Update information (alphabet and node number) of a specific node in the list.
- Display the name by concatenating the alphabets in nodes.

## Usage

The program provides a simple menu-driven interface to manage alphabets in the linked list. Users can perform the following operations:

1. **Insert an Alphabet:** Enter an alphabet (a-z, A-Z) and a corresponding node number to insert it into the list.

2. **Delete an Alphabet:** Enter the alphabet to delete it from the list.

3. **Search for an Alphabet:** Enter the alphabet to search for its corresponding node number in the list.

4. **Update Node Information:** Enter the old alphabet, the new alphabet, and the new node number to update the node's information.

5. **Display the Name:** Display the name formed by concatenating the alphabets in the nodes.

6. **Exit:** Exit the program.
